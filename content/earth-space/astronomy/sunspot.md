type: structure
name: sunspot
domain: earth-space
subdomain: astronomy
level: foundational
status: canonical
definition: A sunspot is a temporary dark region on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity.
  These cooler areas inhibit convection, reducing heat flow and making them appear darker against the
  brighter photosphere while often signaling periods of high solar variability.
