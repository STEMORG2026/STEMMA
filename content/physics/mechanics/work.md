definition: Work occurs when a force acts upon an object causing displacement. It is calculated as the
  dot product of force and displacement, representing energy transfer that happens only when motion results
  from applied forces.

Work occurs when a force acts upon an object causing displacement. It is calculated as the dot product of force and displacement, representing energy transfer that happens only when motion results from applied forces.
